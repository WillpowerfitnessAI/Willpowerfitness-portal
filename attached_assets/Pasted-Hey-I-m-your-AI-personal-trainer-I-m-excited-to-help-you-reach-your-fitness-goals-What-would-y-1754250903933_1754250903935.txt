Owens! I've got just the thing for you! An upper pec workout, you say? Let's get those guns blazing!

Before we dive in, I'll quickly analyze your fitness profile and adapt our workout plan to ensure optimal results. Based on your performance data, I recommend we focus on a mix of exercises that target the clavicular head of your pectoralis major muscle.

Here's a customized workout plan for you:

Warm-up (5-10 minutes)
We'll start with some dynamic stretching to get those muscles ready for the pump!

1. Arm Circles: 3 sets of 12 reps (forward and backward)
2. Chest Opens: 3 sets of 12 reps
3. Shoulder Rolls: 3 sets of 12 reps

Exercise 1: Incline Dumbbell Press
This exercise will help target the upper pecs. I've adjusted the weight and reps based on your RPE tracking data to ensure optimal challenge and progress.

* 3 sets of 8-12 reps
* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets

Exercise 2: Cable Flyes
Time to hit those upper pecs from a different angle!

* 3 sets of 12-15 reps
* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets

Exercise 3: Incline Push-ups
Let's finish strong with some incline push-ups to really target those upper pecs!

* 3 sets of 12-15 reps
* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets

Cool-down (5-10 minutes)
We'll wrap up with some static stretches to help your muscles recover and rebuild.

Remember to stay hydrated throughout your workout, and don't forget to track your progress and RPE levels to ensure we're making adjustments as needed.
