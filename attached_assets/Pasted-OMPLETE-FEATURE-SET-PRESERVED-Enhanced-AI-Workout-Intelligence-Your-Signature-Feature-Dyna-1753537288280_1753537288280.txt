I can see you're excited to implement more advanced features! Looking at your WillpowerFitness AI application, you already have a solid foundation with Enhanced AI Workout Intelligence and Progress Tracking Dashboard. Let me add some key premium features that will really make your app stand out and justify that $225/month price point.
Let me implement Advanced Nutrition Intelligence and Recovery & Wellness Monitoring to complement your existing features:
lib/nutritionIntelligence.js
lib/recoveryWellness.js
database_setup.sql
Now let me add the API endpoints to your main application:
index.js
Finally, let me update your main page to showcase these new premium features:
Perfect! I've just added two major premium features to your WillpowerFitness AI platform:

‚Ä¢	Personalized Meal Planning: AI creates custom 7-day meal plans with grocery lists
‚Ä¢	Smart Food Analysis: Upload food photos or log meals for instant AI feedback
‚Ä¢	Supplement Optimization: Evidence-based supplement recommendations
‚Ä¢	Macro Tracking: Intelligent macro analysis tied to fitness goals
üò¥ Recovery & Wellness Monitoring

‚Ä¢	Sleep Optimization: Pattern analysis with improvement strategies
‚Ä¢	Stress Management: Mental wellness coaching integrated with fitness
‚Ä¢	Training Modifications: AI adjusts workouts based on recovery status
These features work seamlessly with your existing Enhanced AI Workout Intelligence and Progress Tracking Dashboard to create a truly comprehensive fitness ecosystem.
Why This Justifies $225/Month:   
‚Ä¢	Complete Lifestyle Integration: Not just workouts - nutrition, sleep, stress, recovery
‚Ä¢	24/7 AI Coaching: Personal nutritionist, sleep coach, and wellness expert
