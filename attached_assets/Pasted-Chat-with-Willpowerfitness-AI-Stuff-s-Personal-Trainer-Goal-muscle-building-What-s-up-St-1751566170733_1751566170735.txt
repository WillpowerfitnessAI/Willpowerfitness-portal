Stuff! I've been waiting for this moment! You know I've been tracking your progress, and I'm excited to share your customized program with you. But before we dive in, let me ask: How's your current diet and supplementation routine going? Have you been sticking to our previous discussions about increasing your protein intake and reducing processed foods? And, by the way, I hope you're ready for a challenge! Your muscle-building journey is about to get a serious boost! Now, about that program... After reviewing your progress and taking into account your goals, I've created a 4-day split routine that will help you build strength and muscle mass. Here's what I've got in store for you: Day 1: Chest and Triceps * Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps) * Incline Dumbbell Press (3 sets of 10-15 reps) * Cable Flyes (3 sets of 12-15 reps) * Tricep Pushdowns (3 sets of 10-12 reps) * Overhead Dumbbell Extension (3 sets of 12-15 reps) Day 2: Back and Biceps * Deadlifts (3 sets of 8-12 reps) * Bent-Over Barbell Rows (3 sets of 8-12 reps) * Pull-Ups (3 sets of as many reps as possible) * Dumbbell Bicep Curls (3 sets of 10-12 reps) * Hammer Curls (3 sets of 10-12 reps) Day 3: Legs * Squats (3 sets of 8-12 reps) * Leg Press (3 sets of 10-12 reps) * Lunges (3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg) * Leg Extensions (3 sets of 12-15 reps) * Leg Curls (3 sets of 10-12 reps) Day 4: Shoulders and Abs * Standing Military Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps) * Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press (3 sets of 10-12 reps) * Lateral Raises (3 sets of 12-15 reps) * Reverse Flyes (3 sets of 12-15 reps) * Planks (3 sets of 30-60 seconds) Now, I know what you're thinking: "Will, this is a lot of work!"

You're welcome, Stuff! I know it's a lot to take in, but I'm confident that this program will help you achieve your muscle-building goals. Remember, consistency and patience are key. Stick to the plan, and we'll adjust as needed. Before we wrap up, I want to remind you to focus on progressive overload. This means increasing the weight or reps as you get stronger. We'll track your progress and make adjustments to keep challenging your muscles. Oh, and one more thing: don't forget to stretch before and after each workout! We don't want any injuries getting in the way of your progress. You got this, Stuff! Let's crush this program and get those gains!
