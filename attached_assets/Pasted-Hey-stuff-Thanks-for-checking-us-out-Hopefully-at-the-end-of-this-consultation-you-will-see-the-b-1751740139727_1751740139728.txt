I'm excited to have you join the Willpower Fitness community! Before we dive into the specifics, I want to emphasize that your goal is to get stronger. It's not just about exercises or a specific workout routine. It's about sustainable lifestyle changes you can stick to long term. I'm not here to give you a magic bullet or quick fix. I'm here to provide tools, guidance, and support to reach your goals. Here are a few things I'd like you to focus on: 1. Developing a consistent workout routine that you enjoy and can stick to. It's not about doing the most intense or longest workouts, but about finding a rhythm that works for you. 2. Building a strong foundation of nutrition and meal planning. This includes understanding your macronutrient needs, planning your meals, and making healthy choices that fuel your body. 3. Improving your overall mobility and flexibility. This includes stretching, foam rolling, and incorporating exercises that improve your range of motion. 4. Developing a mindset that focuses on progress, not perfection. It's about embracing the journey, celebrating small victories, and learning from setbacks. Let's work together to achieve your goals and build a stronger, healthier you. What specific areas of focus are you most interested in exploring first?
